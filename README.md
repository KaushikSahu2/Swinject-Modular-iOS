# Swinject-Modular-iOS

The objective is to create an application with Modular Architecture Design with the help of Swinject Dependency injection to achieve IoC.

To explore the project just open **MyFirstModule.xcworkspace**.

## What's inside
The workspace has several sub projects:

**App** contains the main app bundle.  
**Modules** contains two distinct sets of feature: _Storage_ , _Push_ and _Logger_.  
**Dependendencies** is where you'll find the public protocol for all modules.

## What can you do
This can be a base for a new project where you want to provide a basic support for modularisation.

Thank you!
